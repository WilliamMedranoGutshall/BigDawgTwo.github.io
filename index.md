## Professional Self-Assessment:

#### Coursework

The Computer Science field encompasses a large variety of topics and gave me a chance to broaden my skill sets. My computer science education began even before I enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University, with over fifteen years of experience working with electronics and programming industrial control systems. Although numerical control programming and ladder logic programming used for machines and robotics utilize a different type of programming, the best practices and thought processes are very similar. This experience along with extensive problem-solving experience that is required in this field is a great foundation for writing and debugging code. The time in this field required frequent interaction and collaboration in a team environment as well as providing feedback to the end user and leadership, which are valuable traits for a junior software developer moving into a career that will likely include team based development for a stakeholder outside the development team. Coming from a career with these similarities would allow me to more easily transition into a team-based development environment and integrate with the team, which would allow me to be value added to a company much quicker than someone without this type of experience. I view my educational progression at Southern New Hampshire University in three steps, introduction to multiple programming languages and best practices, software development life cycle and project planning, and advanced programming skills and application of these skills into projects. 

Programming languages and best practices:

•	**Python** was the first language I learned and it was used to write simple applications and learn to use basic object oriented programming concepts such as variable types, commenting code, using lists and dictionaries, processing inputs and outputs, loops using if where and for commands, and comparisons. 

•	**Java** was the next **object-oriented programming** language and it expanded on programing principles such as method calls and differentiating between private and public fields. I also started learning about programming best practices such as properly commenting for readability, keeping programs as simple as possible, developing iteratively, separating functions into different methods, and to minimize nesting.

•	**C++** was the third object-oriented programming language that I learned and was when I began working with data structures and algorithms to solve problems. For example, I utilized a **hashing algorithm** to generate an output based on a key value and a given input, which is a concept that was utilized later on as a way to verify integrity of a data transmission. Binary Search Trees are algorithms that store data in a specific pattern which can drastically speed up the process of retrieving the data later.  

•	I was also introduced to **data mining, data analytics, and SAS**. SAS is a flexible language that can be used to read data coming from spreadsheets and databases and generate usable output. Living in the age of Big Data and IoT, internet of things, there is an immense amount of data collected; however, for this data to be useful to a company, it requires mining, sorting, filtering, and conversion. Any company that uses data to make business decisions could benefit by hiring someone with experience in these concepts.

•	**MySQL** introduced me to database management by creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from a **relational database**. Databasing is important for any company that collects and uses data because it allows them to store large amounts of information, makes the data quickly and easily sharable, and makes it easy to manage. Databases are often used to store data that is utilized by applications, so having a software developer that is well versed in database management can be a huge asset.

**Project Planning **is an extremely important skill to have because with out the ability to interpret and document requirements and plan the development process, it is unlikely that a development will be successful. It isn’t just enough to be able to write code; a developer needs to be able to plan so they can effectively and efficiently create the correct code that will satisfy the needs of the end user and stakeholder:

•	**SDLC**: Introduction into the software development lifecycle taught me different types of planning such as **Waterfall and Agile** and gave me practice working through the Agile process, which is one of the popular planning methods currently being used by many companies. Agile is an iteration-based planning model that works in short development cycles called sprints. Each sprint plans, develops, and tests a small number of functions. The reason that Agile is popular is because it stresses collaboration in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, and supports the idea of continuous deployment. Having experience running a mock Agile project helps prepare me for real world development with a future employer. 

•	**UML**: Unified Modeling Language is a way to create easy to mange documentation throughout the SDLC. I got to practice working through and managing a complete project including determining the user requirements, writing user stories, generating detailed charts, providing feedback to stakeholders, collaborating with the development team, and documenting the review and testing process. Having a good understanding of the complete process makes me a more valuable developer. 

The final step in my education was taking planning and development skills and utilizing them to complete complex projects:

•	**Collaboration and team projects** utilized **Java, Eclipse IDE, and Github** to create a class project. I learned the process of cloning a repository to create a branch, making changes on my branch, code reviews, testing, pushing and pulling branches, and merging changes with conflict handling back into the master branch which would be available to the entire team. This was my first experience in collaborating in a team environment in school as we worked together to create a jukebox application that included playlists from everyone in the class. Proving the ability to function effectively in a team environment is essential to any company looking to hire a developer. 

•	I was introduced to operating system concepts such as **threads, kernels, and input/output management** by working with a **Java virtual operating system**. Although writing code to create a virtual environment may not be a needed skill, having a detailed understanding of how the operating system works is valuable to help secure applications during development. 

•	Java was used once again to learn how to properly test development projects. This was done by writing **Junit tests** within an Eclipse IDE. Having the skills to properly test my work before merging it with the team’s work will prevent me from causing issues for someone else or holding up the team. 

•	C++ was revisited as the language of choice for the advanced programming application of creating buffers and shaders in **OpenGL** to shift the processor heavy graphics processing from the CPU into the dedicated GPU. I created a three-dimensional object with a lighting source and texture as well as the ability for a user to navigate around and zoom in and out to customize their view. 

•	Python is an effective language to use for writing database management scripts and is the one that I chose to use for managing a **MongoDB No-SQL database**. I performed full-stack development to manage both the client and server sides. This application allowed a client to send appropriate **URL calls, RESTful APIs,** to the **Python script** which would manage the Create Read Update Delete functions with **Pymongo** and return requested data back to the client. No-SQL, **non-relational databases** provide increased flexibility and scalability to a company and the ability to work with both types of databases is a valuable asset. 

Elective skills that I chose to pursue:

•	**HTML, CSS, and Javascript** were the three languages that I learned while working on web development. I created my own website from the ground up, without the use of any web design tools, for a theoretical e-commerce site. These skills are valuable to a company even if web development is handled by a contractor because it introduced me to the concept of working with URLs and hypertext to send data which is used for more than just web development.

•	**Android** development was a chance to enhance my Java programming skill set. Android development utilizes a collection of format files that determine the layout of a mobile page and Java files that manage the functionality. This advanced class gave me a chance to prove my ability to handle the interaction between numerous java files and the necessity of good planning in the creation of a mobile application that could maintain task lists, in either internal memory or **SQLite database** format. 

•	**Cyber security** is important to any company that has a computer network and sensitive information to protect. The ability to harden applications to prevent outside attacks such as buffer overflow through the use of input limitations and proper error handling are a valuable asset to any company looking to employ a software developer. 


#### Overview of the project

Two of the concepts learned in my computer science education are development through iteration and continuous deployment. The agile software development lifecycle breaks development down into sprints, with each sprint adding additional features and resolving issues with previous iterations. The best way to display the skills learned during my education are to simulate an iteration-based development of one of my earliest projects. I chose to start with a zoo authentication application which was my first Java development project. I remember being proud of the fact that I chose the difficult option of utilizing message digest hashing to store and compare passwords, but when I look back on that project, I don’t even recognize the style and design choices because my development skills have evolved so much in the past three years. There is a big difference between someone who has learned a programming language and can write code and a professional developer. Most development projects are complex and are done in teams, which means code needs to be easy to understand and follow, easy to modify and perform maintenance on, and easy to change or add features. Applications launched for use by a user must consider application security and operational decisions to match the needs of the user. 

The three categories of enhancements are software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Since the end goal is to be able to utilize a database which can more effectively store and manage employee files, I made the design choice to start with a program language change. The first sprint would be to rewrite the program in Python instead of Java. In my experience, Python’s simpler structure makes it easier and more effective in working with databases. I performed this iteration by starting with the requirements of the original application development and created a flow chart and broke down each of the requirements into its own user story. These were placed in order and developed such that each user story could be developed, and then developer tested. Finding issues as early in the development process as possible makes it easier to address and solve these issues before they compound. The second sprint focused on adding additional functionality and hardening security. An application that poses a security risk to an organizations network shouldn’t be released and used until it goes through a hardening process. For this iteration, I broke the development down into groups of user stories that included added functionality, error handling, and input validation. Input validation is necessary to prevent attacks such as buffer overflow which happens when more data is coming in than the application allots for and the data is written into the adjacent buffer memory. Additional functionality was used to make the application more useful to an end user. Error handling was used to appropriately and smoothly handle any failure conditions that may arise, such as preventing an application from failing open and exposing the security of the application and network. I evaluated all the user stories needed and then developed and developer tested each one. The third sprint was to incorporate a database for storage. This makes sense for a zoo management application because not every employee is going to have the same daily tasks to complete, not even ones with the same job titles. Without the database, daily tasks could be individualized based on a feature such as job titles, but it is extremely time consuming and impractical to manage employee tasks within the confines of an application’s code. The user stories were created for each of the CRUD, create read update delete, features. Requirement evaluation was determined which types of users would receive access to each of these features, such as zookeepers only having access to their daily tasks but an HR administrator had full access to create a new user task, delete a user task, view their own or someone else’s tasks, and to update tasks. This planning was important to maintain the concept of least privilege where employees are only given the minimum amount of access needed to do their work. Through this development, broken down into three sprints, I was not only able to show that I have strong coding skills, but I understand the software development lifecycle, understand the access and management of databases through scripting, application of development best practices to allow me smooth integration into a development team, as well as implementing hardening process to properly secure important data. This project shows that I am a complete Computer Science professional. 

## Code Review:
Code review is the use of a person or automation to assist in the finding of errors, bad design, and opportunities for improvement. Software development is done by people and thus is prone to mistakes and bugs. Code review helps ensure quality and prevents negatively impacting other developers in a team environment.
