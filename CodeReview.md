### Code Review:
Code review is the use of a person or automation to assist in the finding of errors, bad design, and opportunities for improvement. Software development is done by people and thus is prone to mistakes and bugs. As a programmer writing code, we create an emotional attachment to our work and want to believe that our work is correct. Developers also have an insight into the thought process that went into the design and development which means that things that seem clear to the person who wrote the code won’t necessarily seem clear to someone else. This means that as the developer of the code, we are more likely to overlook errors and design flaws, which is why it is crucial to bring in someone else to review the code. Even if the code has been completely debugged and is 100% functional and meets the requirements, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the code meets quality standards. Developers typically work in groups with each person taking on different portions, and code needs to be able to be modified for future changes or expansions. This means that it is also important that the code be simple for another developer to understand and change if necessary. It is extremely difficult for a developer to make this determination on their own, which is why code review is crucial to group development as well. 

Some of the techniques used for code review include email thread, pair programming, over-the-shoulder, and tool assisted (Huston, 2019). Email thread is an informal approach where the developer sends the code off to fellow developers to be reviewed when time permits (Huston, 2019). This method is flexible but often leaves the developer with numerous different viewpoints which could make determining the direction difficult. Pair programming is often used when a senior developer is mentoring a junior developer and the two developers work side by side working on the same code and checking each other’s work along the way (Huston, 2019). Although this method is a good learning process for the junior developer, it uses more resources and since both developers are involved in the code, it has some of the same drawback of self-review such as emotional attachment. Over-the-shoulder is a review process where the developer sits with another developer as that person reviews their code (Huston, 2019). This informal approach is a great way to get immediate feedback and gives the developer a chance to interact and discuss things with the reviewer; however, this method often lacks tracking and documentation. Another way to perform review is by using automation, or tool assisted code review. This type of method creates good documentation, doesn’t tie up development resources, and some of these tools even allow the entering of requirement information to be reviewed (Huston, 2019); however, this method leaves out the human factor such as can another developer easily follow the code and the ability to ask the reviewer to clarify or assist with suggestions. Code review should be completed after the developer testing phase. This means that after the section of code is completed, the developer should run unit tests to verify the functionality of the code and eliminate any errors. These tests are typically automated, and they can be written by automated applications or written by the developer through testing resources such as JUnit. After the developer testing is completed, then the code moves into the code review phase. 

At the start of the code review phase, it is good practice for the developer to make sure the source code is properly annotated before passing it off to another developer. This is important because the commenting and annotations made in the source code will allow the reviewer to better understand the thought process of the developer, follow the code easier, and thus be able to provide better feedback to the developer (SmartBear, 2019). The foundation for a productive review is the implementation of a positive code review culture. It is often difficult to take criticism of work that we have an emotional attachment to, and by using the best practice of maintaining a positive culture, it makes the developer more likely to accept and utilize the information provided in the review. I believe that a good code review doesn’t just include what was done wrong or what the reviewer didn’t like, but it also includes what the developer did right and suggestions for how to correct or improve the recommendations. The positives help put the developer into a more comfortable and less defensive mindset and including suggestions for improvements helps the developer understand the mindset of the reviewer. Another best practice is to use lightweight code reviews. According to SmartBear, lightweight code reviews only consume about 20% of the time of formal reviews and they find just as many bugs (2019). The last set of best practices that I advocate are reviewing fewer than 400 lines of code and not to review for more than 60 minutes at a time. According to SmartBear, the mind can only process a certain amount of information, and after 400 lines of code and 60 minutes, the ability to find defects diminishes, and these limitations will be the most efficient because they should yield between 70% to 90% of defect discovery (2019). The one practice that I haven’t really heard discussed before, but I think is important is to not rely on the code review to fix issues. It may seem like the easiest approach, but a code review is about defect discovery and not about leaving defects for someone else to find a solution for. Before code is put up for review it should be fully functional and properly tested by the developer.
